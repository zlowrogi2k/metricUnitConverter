# metricUnitConverter
This is a simple program that does not loop *yet* and converst kilometers into miles and vice versa.
It's made to work on linux ONLY.
HOWEVER, you may try to compile it on your system. You need the same header files that are used in the 'main.c' source file. By default, they are installed along gcc, but on Windows you may need to use the MinGW installer to get it working.
